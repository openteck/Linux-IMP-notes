CentOS: Upgrading from manually downloaded Omnibus package
To upgrade you will need to add the package repository to your system first. 

Use the following:
curl https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ce/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash
If you are not comfortable installing the repository through a piped script, you can find the entire script here. 

Now you will be able to install / upgrade GitLab to the latest version using the package repository. When running the command below, GitLab will detect a conflict and remove gitlab in favor of gitlab-ce. 

To upgrade, run:
sudo yum install gitlab-ce
